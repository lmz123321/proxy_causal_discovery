## Proximal Causal Discovery
This repository contains the official implementations for the following papers:
- Mingzhou Liu et al. [Causal Discovery from Subsampled Time Series with Proxy Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05276). NeurIPS 2023.
- Mingzhou Liu et al. [Causal Discovery with Unobserved Variables: A Proxy Variable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05281). ICML 2024.
## Time Series Discovery

- ``simulation`` contains the code I use for synthetic study in the paper
- ``real_world`` contains the code for ADNI causal discovery
- ``tools`` contains all the utils functions

(I am currently working on a more comprehensive version of codes and readme, I will update them as song as I finish ^_^ )
